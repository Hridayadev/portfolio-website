           <div>Prior to my enrollment in BSc CSIT at Mechi Multiple Campus, my journey as a non-IT individual was marked by a profound lack of familiarity with anything related to website development or other technical facets. <br>As I delved into the world of technology, it became evident, within a span of 1 to 2 months, that a portfolio site was a necessity for all aspiring professionals. Eager to craft my own digital footprint, I embarked on the journey of creating a personal portfolio site, only to be confronted with the formidable challenge of my non-coding background. <br> Nonetheless, through consistent effort and perseverance, I gradually grasped the intricacies of web development, though my learning journey continues unabated. </div> <br>
            <div>Despite my ongoing efforts, the site remains a work in progress, not yet achieving the level of completion I initially envisaged. However, I remain resolute in my determination to enrich its functionality and aesthetic appeal.</div>
